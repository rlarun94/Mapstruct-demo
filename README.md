# Mapstruct-demo
Describes about MapStruct concept

MapStruct is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach.

(Simple Definition: Conversion from one Domain object to another Domain object.)

Once we build the Project we will get the Impl file for the Mapper class.

Mapper Class: CarMapper (location: src/main/java/org/example/mapper/CarMapper.java)
Mapper Implementation Class: CarMapperImpl (location: target/generated-sources/annotations/org/example/mapper/CarMapperImpl.java)
